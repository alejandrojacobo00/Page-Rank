# Page-Rank
The PageRank program is a rudimentary algorithm that search engines used early into their inception to filter and sort websites based on their “rank”. This rank was based on other websites who had links to the source website. The more inbound links a website had, the higher its rank would be. Every inbound link is not worth the same though, as a link coming from a website with a high rank is worth more than one from a small rank. For example, if my website joe.shmo.com had an inbound link from usa.gov, it would immediately be a higher rank than if it had 10 inbound links from small personal blog websites
